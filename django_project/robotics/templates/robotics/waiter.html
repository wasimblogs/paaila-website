            <p class="text" style="text-align:left;padding:0 2vw">
                These are series of intelligent waiter robots ready to deliver food and drinks to your invaluable
                customers at your restaurants. All you have to do it place the food on the multiple trays on the robot
                and hit the table number on the robotâ€™s screen. The robot will then interact locally not just with the
                restaurant environment but also with other sets of robots, distributing tasks, preventing collision and
                co-operating to deliver the order to your esteemed customers. Instead of depending on the customer to
                fetch the food, waiter robot places the tray on the table by itself, delighting your customers.
